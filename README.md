## About the Creator

Hi, I’m **Anthony Thompson**. I’m building TeeTime to create a better future — not just for my wife and kids, but for families everywhere. After facing real-life challenges including incarceration, the loss of my brother, and watching my mother suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia, I realized how powerful it would be to create something meaningful.
