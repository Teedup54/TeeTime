# TeeTime

**One App. One Vision. A Future for Families Everywhere.**

TeeTime is an all-in-one fintech and search platform built to empower everyday people. Send, receive, and store money like Cash App or PayPal, and search the web like Google or Yahoo — all in one secure, easy-to-use app.

## Why TeeTime?

I created TeeTime to build a better life for my wife and kids, and to honor my mother who is battling Alzheimer’s. I lost my brother while I was incarcerated — mental health, financial stability, and family mean everything to me.

## Help Us Grow

We’re building TeeTime from scratch with zero funding. If you believe in supporting innovation, families, and mental health awareness, your help would mean the world.
