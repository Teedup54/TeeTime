# TeeTime: One App. One Vision. A Future for Families Everywhere.

Welcome to **TeeTime**, a revolutionary all-in-one platform aiming to combine a search engine and a fintech app in a single experience — built for everyday families, by someone who understands the struggles of everyday life.

This app is built with a vision: to support families, promote mental health awareness, and create a better financial future — starting with my own family. Every visit, every donation, and every show of support makes a difference.

## **My Story**

My name is **Anthony Thompson**, and I created TeeTime out of personal need and passion. After losing my brother while I was incarcerated and watching my mom suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia, I struggled with mental health and finding a stable way to support my wife and kids.

TeeTime is my chance — our chance — to build something meaningful that can bring financial freedom, mental wellness, and hope to countless people.
